"Elm aims to make web development more pleasant. Elm is a type inferred, functional reactive language that compiles to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript." -- from [the elm-compiler Github repo](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler).

Is it a new functional language, a Javascript library, or somebody's trendy computer science project? Worth investigating...
