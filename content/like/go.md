I started using [Go](https://golang.org/) with free web application services such as [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). My reason for choosing it was due to performance, combined with ease of coding. It is high level enough, while still being a compiled, high performance language. This, then, saves on resources, and saves money.
