From [the Lua "about" page](http://www.lua.org/about.html):

> Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.

> Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
