<h1>Go</h1>

<p>I started using <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> with free web application services such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> and <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. My reason for choosing it was due to performance, combined with ease of coding. It is high level enough, while still being a compiled, high performance language. This, then, saves on resources, and saves money. I am able to have an app with high usage while remaining in the free tier.</p>
