<h1>Lua</h1>

<p>From <a href="http://www.lua.org/about.html">the Lua &ldquo;about&rdquo; page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.</p>

<p>Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.</p>
